Currently, the assembler doesn't support passes that would alter label locations.
Examples of this would be the LI, CALL, and TAIL pseudo-insts (grow) or compressed inst swaps (shrink).

There is currently a chicken and the egg problem:
labels depend on inst sizes
immediates depend on labels
inst sizes depend on immediates

labels -> sizes
imms   -> labels
sizes  -> imms

How can this be avoided?
How do traditional assemblers / linkers solve this?
